# Task 3
1 Draw the High Level System Diagram for Car Crash `Predictor App` and `Smart-O-Meter`.
2 Take sometime to read about the conventions and best practices for drawing HSLD [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.infoq.com%2Farticles%2Fcrafting-architectural-diagrams&h=AT0WXby--NKQD2IZJE35NHKgQApqU05RjhEI2MM_3XkKW9vcvtoTFM9_WkpHdb5SEm9MFOBM-l44AuU19Hc51pV-whaoXeZfcOoKiANkFgERoeRZb-7FaFgDroN7OmHPlDtTmQ)
3 You can use any online tool for creating the diagrams, my personal recommendation [is draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)
4 After creating the both diagrams export the diagrams as `.vsdx` (visio files) files and submit on the Github.
5 Also take time to explain what you have tried to show in the diagram using comments in draw.io.
6 You can find detailed description of `Smart-O-Meter` [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=2CFE8D8AD2347F56%211437&page=Edit&wdLOR=&wd=target%28Quick%20Notes.one%7Cedc96e72-4ec2-4bee-954e-440fc6f0966e%2FSmart%20O%20Meter%7C9f3ea3bc-e143-42a1-a312-51f63180422c%2F%29&wdorigin=703)

### Best of Luck.
